# fractal-trees
An SDL expirement in C inspired by an assignment my roommates were given a while back

More or less a learning exercise in making memory/performance efficient programs while
using dynamically allocated things less (last test program I made turned into a memory
nightmare)

Might be helpful to someone, but probably won't
